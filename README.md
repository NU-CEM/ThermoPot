Ab-initio thermodynamic modelling package
============================

Software for ab-initio thermodynamic modelling of material formation and decomposition.

With tutorial examples for the BaZrS<sub>3</sub> system.

*Note: This repository has been built on one previously developed for a [thermodynamic model of CZTS](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57130). 
It adapts and extends (with copyright permissions) code originally designed and written by Adam Jackson.*
