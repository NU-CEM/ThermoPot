ThermoPot can be installed using the Python package manader `pip`:

`pip install thermopot`

If you use conda/anaconda, the safest thing to do is to create a new environment and then install ThermoPot:

```
conda create -n thermopot python
conda activate thermopot
pip install thermopot
```

If you wish, you can install the very latest version of ThermoPot from Github. Note that although the latest Github version may include more features, it may not be stable. To install the latest, possibly unstable version:

```
git clone https://github.com/NU-CEM/ThermoPot.git
cd ThermoPot
pip install .
```
