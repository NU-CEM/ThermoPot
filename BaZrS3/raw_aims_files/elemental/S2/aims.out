          and our main development and support site at

            https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de .

          The latter site, in particular, has a wiki to collect information, as well
          as an issue tracker to log discussions, suggest improvements, and report issues
          or bugs. https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de is also the main development site
          of the project and all new and updated code versions can be obtained there.
          Please send an email to aims-coordinators@fhi-berlin.mpg.de and we will add
          you to these sites. They are for you and everyone is welcome there.

  Target number of points in a grid batch is not set. Defaulting to  100
  Method for grid partitioning is not set. Defaulting to parallel hash+maxmin partitioning.
  Batch size limit is not set. Defaulting to    200
  By default, will store active basis functions for each batch.
  If in need of memory, prune_basis_once .false. can be used to disable this option.
  communication_type for Hartree potential was not specified.
  Defaulting to calc_hartree .

  | (-- VB: in principle, multipole_radius_free should be larger, hence this output)
  | Species        1: Confinement radius =              6.000000000000000 AA, multipole_radius_free =              6.012827091137924 AA.
  | Species        1: outer_partition_radius set to              6.012827091137924 AA .
  | The sparse table of interatomic distances needs          0.04 kbyte instead of         0.03 kbyte of memory.
  | Using the partition_type stratmann_smoother will reduce your memory usage.

  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system

  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -5.24090130 eV
  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.24090130 eV
  | Occupation number:      1.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.24090130 eV
  | Occupation number:      1.00000000

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00000000 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -5.24266054 eV

  | Occupation number:      1.00000000

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00000000 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -21721.453204825 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -21721.481414304 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:        0.597 MB (on task  68 after allocating hessian_basis_wave)
          |   Maximum:        0.679 MB (on task   5 after allocating hessian_basis_wave)
          |   Average:        0.672 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        0.296 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task  68)
          |   Maximum:        0.345 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task   5)
          |   Average:        0.341 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
