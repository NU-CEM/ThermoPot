          and our main development and support site at

            https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de .

          The latter site, in particular, has a wiki to collect information, as well
          as an issue tracker to log discussions, suggest improvements, and report issues
          or bugs. https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de is also the main development site
          of the project and all new and updated code versions can be obtained there.
          Please send an email to aims-coordinators@fhi-berlin.mpg.de and we will add
          you to these sites. They are for you and everyone is welcome there.

  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Ba atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.66127586 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.50642287
  | K-point:     387 at    0.125000    0.312500    0.375000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.62554154 eV (relative to internal zero)

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.65968409 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.49640933
  | K-point:    1967 at    0.875000    0.625000    0.687500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.62374514 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00001016
  | K-point:     903 at    0.312500    0.000000    0.375000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.03593895 eV between HOMO at k-point 1967 and LUMO at k-point 903
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.22066396 eV for k_point 832 at    0.250000    0.625000    0.437500 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -5.60339599 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.

  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -5.60363225 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.62092473 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.37578278
  | K-point:     925 at    0.312500    0.125000    0.187500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.57990654 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.50267465
  | K-point:      62 at    0.000000    0.312500    0.312500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04101819 eV between HOMO at k-point 925 and LUMO at k-point 62
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.21957499 eV for k_point 1750 at    0.687500    0.250000    0.437500 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -5.60360478 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.61792975 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.70996086
  | K-point:     543 at    0.187500    0.125000    0.375000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.57967938 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.29853679
  | K-point:     959 at    0.312500    0.312500    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.03825037 eV between HOMO at k-point 543 and LUMO at k-point 959
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.21811189 eV for k_point 980 at    0.312500    0.375000    0.750000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -225060.520483951 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -225060.521230833 eV
  | Total energy after non-SC SOC correction (DO NOT USE)          :        -225060.652057427 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -14.135203588 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
