  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Ba atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -8.45879470 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.30567902 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      2.15311568 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95112291 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110948 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110734 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110752 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110695 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110750 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.81840992 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.91423354 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90417638 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110749 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.81840992 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.91423355 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90417637 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110749 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.81840990 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.91423353 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90417637 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.95110749 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.81840990 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.91423353 eV (relative to internal zero)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90417637 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.81840990 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.91423353 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90417637 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -6.95110749 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.92740873 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.93685888 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.93682586 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.93682611 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.83855614 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.89995260 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.93860354 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.83855614 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.89995260 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.93860354 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -6.93682611 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.60307664 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.05445168
  | K-point:      11 at    0.000000    0.125000    0.333333 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.60212694 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.94737036
  | K-point:     355 at    0.416667    0.125000    0.833333 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00094970 eV between HOMO at k-point 11 and LUMO at k-point 355
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.00461493 eV for k_point 200 at    0.250000    0.000000    0.583333 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.83623113 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01892915 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02156083 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87558918 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,

  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02160422 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02159930 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.86027551 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98472584 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87554967 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02159930 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87554967 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02159929 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.86027550 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98472583 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87554967 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.02159929 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.86027550 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98472583 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87554967 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.86027550 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98472583 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.87554967 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.02159929 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.67965354 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.18435750
  | K-point:      66 at    0.083333    0.125000    0.666667 (in units of recip. lattice)

  | Occupation number:      0.94041067
  | K-point:     558 at    0.916667    0.000000    0.583333 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00217723 eV between HOMO at k-point 66 and LUMO at k-point 558
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00707006 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00706968 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87098080 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97019651 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90078429 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00706967 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87098080 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90078430 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00706967 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87098080 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97019651 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90078430 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87098080 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97019651 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90078430 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.00706967 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00529747 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00534679 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00534716 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87447198 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.96847372 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90599825 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00534716 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87447198 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90599825 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87447198 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.96847372 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90599825 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.00534716 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00515074 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00517263 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00517315 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87336464 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.96829921 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90506543 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00517315 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87336464 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90506543 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87336464 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.96829921 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90506543 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.00517315 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00765635 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00766397 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00766364 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87683717 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97079013 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90604704 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00766364 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87683716 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97079012 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90604704 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00766364 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87683716 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97079012 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90604704 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87683716 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97079012 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90604704 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.00766364 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87961948 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97209127 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90752821 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00911915 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00920352 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00920234 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87961328 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97232864 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90728463 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00920233 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87961328 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90728462 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.00920233 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87961329 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97232866 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90728462 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.87961329 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97232866 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.90728462 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.00920233 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89142503 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97781906 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91360598 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01508642 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01548557 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01548736 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89141671 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97861279 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91280392 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01548612 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89141670 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97861278 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91280392 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01548612 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89141670 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97861278 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91280392 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01548612 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89141670 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97861278 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91280392 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89141670 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97861278 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91280392 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01548612 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01684549 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89353596 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97997226 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91356370 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01684549 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89353595 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97997226 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91356369 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89353595 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97997226 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91356369 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01684549 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01705576 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01702582 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89504516 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98015239 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91489276 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89504516 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.98015239 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91489276 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01702582 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01645976 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01645919 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89382885 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97958614 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91424271 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01645920 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89382884 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97958613 eV (relative to internal zero)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91424271 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01645920 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89382884 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91424271 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89382884 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97958613 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91424271 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01645920 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01626800 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89330477 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97939405 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91391072 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89330477 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97939405 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91391072 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01626800 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.01642104 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.89309331 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.97954737 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000018
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.91354594 eV between HOMO at k-point 1 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.01642104 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :       -1425527.242293350 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :       -1425527.242293350 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -16.930927802 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

 *********************************************************************
   Your are running FHI-aims on many cores. To achieve optimal
   performance for your particular architecture, it might be necessary
   to tune the following compilation and calculation settings:
    * Choosing the right Scalapack and MPI Libraries for your
       architecture is essential. If in doubt, refer to the
       documentation or the sysadmin of your supercomputer.
    * Please review our documentation of Makefile choices, particularly
       for ELPA, in the manual.
    * Some of the following FHI-aims keywords or combination thereof
       may be helpful:
        - FHI-aims setting: use_local_index .true.
        - FHI-aims setting: load_balancing .true.
        - FHI-aims setting: use_alltoall .false.
   Be mindful that the usefulness of these keywords can depend on your
   actual run and on the actual computer you are using. Please check
   their description in the manual and perform specific benchmarks to
   determine what is optimal for your computer. More detailed
   information and examples can be found at:
