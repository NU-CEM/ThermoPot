  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Ba atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.61552987 eV between HOMO at k-point 108 and LUMO at k-point 1181

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.02100110 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:     225 at    0.062500    0.875000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.20031471 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:    1181 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.82068639 eV between HOMO at k-point 225 and LUMO at k-point 1181
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.58267457 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -6.97959886 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.01234152 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.00000000
  | K-point:     234 at    0.062500    0.937500    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.20053034 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000002
  | K-point:    1181 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.81181118 eV between HOMO at k-point 234 and LUMO at k-point 1181
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.55628619 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical potential is  -6.239483 eV.

  | writing DOS (raw data) to file KS_DOS_total_raw.dat
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -120544.859981226 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -120544.859981226 eV
  | Total energy after non-SC SOC correction (DO NOT USE)          :        -120544.896828817 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -15.234591804 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
