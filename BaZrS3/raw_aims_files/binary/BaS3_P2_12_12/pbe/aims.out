  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Ba atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.94334788 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999973
  | K-point:     373 at    0.333333    0.125000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  | K-point:       8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.14939764 eV between HOMO at k-point 373 and LUMO at k-point 8
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.94098254 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999973
  | K-point:     373 at    0.333333    0.125000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.80303042 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.13795212 eV between HOMO at k-point 373 and LUMO at k-point 8
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.22298598 eV for k_point 169 at    0.166667    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.68391177 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.68391190 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.72028942 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999973
  | K-point:     373 at    0.333333    0.125000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.73872354 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.98156588 eV between HOMO at k-point 373 and LUMO at k-point 8
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.06216679 eV for k_point 8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.72028942 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999973
  | K-point:     373 at    0.333333    0.125000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.73872354 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.98156588 eV between HOMO at k-point 373 and LUMO at k-point 8
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.06216679 eV for k_point 8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -6.68391190 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.71628504 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.00000000
  | K-point:     445 at    0.333333    0.875000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.73719555 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000117
  | K-point:       8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.97908949 eV between HOMO at k-point 445 and LUMO at k-point 8
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.06104576 eV for k_point 8 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :       -1031161.462814959 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :       -1031161.462814959 eV
  | Total energy after non-SC SOC correction (DO NOT USE)          :       -1031161.858593535 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -14.977052249 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
