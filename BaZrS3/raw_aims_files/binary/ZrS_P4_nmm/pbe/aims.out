  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.99388202 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.12559350
  | K-point:     532 at    0.187500    0.062500    0.437500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -5.99226684 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.94390957
  | K-point:       9 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.750000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00161518 eV between HOMO at k-point 532 and LUMO at k-point 9
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.04002745 eV for k_point 5 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.312500 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.04763921 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05341591 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00289777 eV between HOMO at k-point 82 and LUMO at k-point 1297

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05104107 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.05207654 eV (relative to internal zero)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00150492 eV between HOMO at k-point 2025 and LUMO at k-point 902
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.02128471 eV for k_point 902 at    0.312500    0.000000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05120970 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05125563 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.05212269 eV (relative to internal zero)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00134905 eV between HOMO at k-point 1465 and LUMO at k-point 61
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05125599 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05125446 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -6.05125415 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.05211851 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.01949794
  | K-point:    1609 at    0.562500    0.062500    0.187500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.05077334 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.98914280
  | K-point:      61 at    0.000000    0.312500    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00134518 eV between HOMO at k-point 1609 and LUMO at k-point 61
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.02128379 eV for k_point 61 at    0.000000    0.312500    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -6.05125445 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level) in eV                 : -.60520677E+01
  | Error in electron count due to remaining E_F inaccuracy: 0.28421709E-13
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.
  | Maximum occupation number of highest empty state:  0.00E+00

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.05242494 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.50403062
  | K-point:     217 at    0.062500    0.437500    0.187500 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.04991981 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.47577817
  | K-point:    1483 at    0.500000    0.000000    0.875000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00250514 eV between HOMO at k-point 217 and LUMO at k-point 1483
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.03485510 eV for k_point 5 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.312500 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  | writing DOS (raw data) to file KS_DOS_total_raw.dat
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -219328.462254458 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -219328.464051834 eV
  | Total energy after non-SC SOC correction (DO NOT USE)          :        -219328.546031634 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -22.695708399 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
